      In connection with the case, In Re Payment Card Interchange Fee and
      Merchant Discount Antitrust Litigation (the
      <strong>“Visa/MasterCard Settlement”</strong>) or (the
      <strong>“Interchange Fee Settlement”</strong>), Brownstone Recovery Group,
      Inc. and its agents and representatives (collectively,
      <strong>“Service Provider”</strong>) will provide to merchants the
      following claim recovery services (collectively, the
      <strong>“Services”</strong>):
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Request from the merchant, client information and documents reasonably
        necessary to determine eligibility for, and to pursue recovery of, any
        potential Interchange Fee Settlement claims.
      </li>
      <li>
        Review, organize, and identify gaps in client-provided information and
        documents.
      </li>
      <li>Determine claim eligibility.</li>
      <li>
        For each eligible claim (each, a <strong>“Claim”</strong>), prepare
        applicable claim forms and supporting documentation.
      </li>
      <li>
        Submit claim forms and supporting documentation for each Claim to the
        Interchange Fee Settlement claims administrator.
      </li>
      <li>
        Follow up with the claims administrator to obtain an estimate of the
        amount payable with respect to each Claim (in each case, a
        <strong>“Claim Estimate”</strong>), if not otherwise provided.
      </li>
      <li>
        Evaluate the sufficiency of each Claim Estimate, on the basis of
        information made available to Service Provider and to the extent deemed
        appropriate by Service Provider.
      </li>
      <li>
        To the extent permitted by the settlement agreement and commercially
        reasonable, contest, challenge, and appeal the Claim Estimate or any
        claim denial with respect to each Claim with a view to maximizing the
        final determination of the recovery amount with respect to such Claim
        (in each case, the <strong>“Recovery Amount”</strong>).
      </li>
      <li>
        Obtain from the claims administrator payment of the Recovery Amount with
        respect to each Claim as soon as practicable after the final
        determination thereof is made.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the claims administrator makes any pro rata or other additional
        distribution of the remaining balance of any settlement fund to
        settlement fund claimants, obtain from such claims administrator all
        residual amounts payable with respect to each Claim in connection with
        such distribution (in each case, the
        <strong>“Residual Amount”</strong>).
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>The undersigned (<strong>“Client”</strong>) understands that:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Service Provider is not affiliated with any court, claims administrator,
        class counsel, or other parties associated with any Interchange Fee
        Settlement.
      </li>
      <li>
        Service Provider is not a law firm and does not and will not give Client
        any legal advice.
      </li>
      <li>
        Service Provider does not guarantee that any potential claim will be
        eligible, that any eligible claim will result in a recovery, that any
        approved Claim will result in a Recovery Amount greater than the Claim
        Estimate for such Claim, or that any approved Claim will result in any
        Residual Amount payment.
      </li>
      <li>
        Client is not required to avail itself of Service Provider’s Services,
        but is instead entitled to pursue each Claim itself directly with the
        claims administrator of each Interchange Fee Settlement.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding the foregoing, Client has determined that, in light of the
      time, effort, and cost it might take to pursue each Claim itself, as well
      as Client’s relative lack of experience and knowledge pursuing claims in
      the nature of those in connection with the Interchange Fee Settlements, it
      is in Client’s best interest to engage Service Provider to pursue all such
      claims on Client’s behalf.
    </p>
    <p>
      In consideration of the foregoing and the other terms and conditions of
      this agreement, the parties agree as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      Client hereby irrevocably appoints Service Provider as Client’s sole and
      exclusive agent to pursue and recover each claim that Client may have
      under the Interchange Fee Settlement. Client hereby irrevocably authorizes
      Service Provider to act as the sole point of contact for any court, claims
      administrator, class counsel, or other parties associated with any
      Interchange Fee Settlement; to prepare, sign, and submit claims forms with
      respect to each potential Claim; to receive, endorse, negotiate, and
      deposit settlement checks with respect to any Claim; and to take all other
      actions reasonably necessary to evaluate, prepare, pursue, and maximize
      each potential Claim, and to respond to any audit or inquiry with respect
      thereto. Client will reasonably cooperate with Service Provider to
      facilitate all such actions. In furtherance of that end, Client will:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Provide to Service Provider all information in Client’s possession that
        Service Provider reasonably determines is required to determine the
        eligibility of, prepare, or submit any potential Claim, to evaluate,
        contest, challenge, or appeal any Claim Estimate, to respond to any
        Claim-related audit or inquiry, or otherwise to provide the Services
        (collectively, “Claim Submission Data”). Upon Service Provider’s
        request, Client will represent to Service Provider in writing that the
        Claim Submission Data it provides to Service Provider is accurate and
        complete.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sign and have notarized from time to time such limited powers of
        attorney as Service Provider may reasonably request.
      </li>
      <li>
        Refrain from communicating directly with any court, claims
        administrator, class counsel, or other parties associated with any
        Interchange Fee Settlement.
      </li>
      <li>
        Retain all Claim Submission Data relevant to its Claims until notified
        that the Interchange Fee Settlement claim process is complete.
      </li>
      <li>
        If any Recovery Amount or Residual Amount is, despite Service Provider’s
        contrary instructions to any applicable claims administrator, paid
        directly to Client, promptly pay to Service Provider the full amount of
        the fees it would have been entitled pursuant to this agreement to
        retain out of such Recovery Amount or Residual Amount, as the case may
        be, if payment had been made directly to Service Provider.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      As full and complete compensation for the Services (including any expenses
      incurred by Service Provider in connection with providing the Services),
      Service Provider will be entitled to retain 30.0 percent of the Recovery
      Amount and, if applicable, 30.0 percent of the Residual Amount actually
      paid with respect to each Claim.
    </p>
    <p>
      No amendment of this agreement will be enforceable unless such amendment
      is in writing, expressly refers to this agreement, and is signed by each
      party.
    </p>
    <p>
      This agreement will be governed exclusively by and construed and enforced
      exclusively in accordance with the laws of New York. Each party hereby
      submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of any court of New York and any
      federal court of the United States of America, in either case, sitting in
      the city and county of New York, and any appellate court therefrom, over
      all legal actions relating to this agreement or the Services.
    </p>
    <p>
      The non-prevailing party in any legal action between the parties relating
      to this agreement or the Services will promptly reimburse the prevailing
      party for all reasonable attorneys’ fees and court costs incurred by the
      prevailing party in connection with such legal action.

      Claim forms are not yet available from the Class Administrator. When claim
      forms do become available, class members are not required to sign up with
      any third-party service in order to participate in the monetary relief,
      but may instead file their claim directly with the Class Administrator.
      The claim form will inform most class members of their actual or estimated
      interchange fees on which it is proposed their claims will be paid. You
      may accept or dispute this estimate with the opportunity to submit
      additional information. No-cost assistance will be available from the
      Class Administrator and Class Counsel during the claims-filing period. For
      additional information, class members may visit
      www.paymentcardsettlement.com, the Court-approved website for this case.
