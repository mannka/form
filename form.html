        In connection with the case, In Re Payment Card Interchange Fee and
        Merchant Discount Antitrust Litigation (the
        <strong>“Visa/MasterCard Settlement”</strong>) or (the
        <strong>“Interchange Fee Settlement”</strong>), Brownstone Recovery
        Group, Inc. and its agents and representatives (collectively,
        <strong>“Service Provider”</strong>) will provide to merchants the
        following claim recovery services (collectively, the
        <strong>“Services”</strong>):
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Request from the merchant, client information and documents reasonably
          necessary to determine eligibility for, and to pursue recovery of, any
          potential Interchange Fee Settlement claims.
        </li>
        <li>
          Review, organize, and identify gaps in client-provided information and
          documents.
        </li>
        <li>Determine claim eligibility.</li>
        <li>
          For each eligible claim (each, a <strong>“Claim”</strong>), prepare
          applicable claim forms and supporting documentation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Submit claim forms and supporting documentation for each Claim to the
          Interchange Fee Settlement claims administrator.
        </li>
        <li>
          Follow up with the claims administrator to obtain an estimate of the
          amount payable with respect to each Claim (in each case, a
          <strong>“Claim Estimate”</strong>), if not otherwise provided.
        </li>
        <li>
          Evaluate the sufficiency of each Claim Estimate, on the basis of
          information made available to Service Provider and to the extent
          deemed appropriate by Service Provider.
        </li>
        <li>
          To the extent permitted by the settlement agreement and commercially
          reasonable, contest, challenge, and appeal the Claim Estimate or any
          claim denial with respect to each Claim with a view to maximizing the
          final determination of the recovery amount with respect to such Claim
          (in each case, the <strong>“Recovery Amount”</strong>).
        </li>
        <li>
          Obtain from the claims administrator payment of the Recovery Amount
          with respect to each Claim as soon as practicable after the final
          determination thereof is made.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the claims administrator makes any pro rata or other additional
          distribution of the remaining balance of any settlement fund to
          settlement fund claimants, obtain from such claims administrator all
          residual amounts payable with respect to each Claim in connection with
          such distribution (in each case, the
          <strong>“Residual Amount”</strong>).
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>The undersigned (<strong>“Client”</strong>) understands that:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Service Provider is not affiliated with any court, claims
          administrator, class counsel, or other parties associated with any
          Interchange Fee Settlement.
        </li>
        <li>
          Service Provider is not a law firm and does not and will not give
          Client any legal advice.
        </li>
        <li>
          Service Provider does not guarantee that any potential claim will be
          eligible, that any eligible claim will result in a recovery, that any
          approved Claim will result in a Recovery Amount greater than the Claim
          Estimate for such Claim, or that any approved Claim will result in any
          Residual Amount payment.
        </li>
        <li>
          Client is not required to avail itself of Service Provider’s Services,
          but is instead entitled to pursue each Claim itself directly with the
          claims administrator of each Interchange Fee Settlement.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Notwithstanding the foregoing, Client has determined that, in light of
        the time, effort, and cost it might take to pursue each Claim itself, as
        well as Client’s relative lack of experience and knowledge pursuing
        claims in the nature of those in connection with the Interchange Fee
        Settlements, it is in Client’s best interest to engage Service Provider
        to pursue all such claims on Client’s behalf.
      </p>
      <p>
        In consideration of the foregoing and the other terms and conditions of
        this agreement, the parties agree as follows:
      </p>
      <p>
        Client hereby irrevocably appoints Service Provider as Client’s sole and
        exclusive agent to pursue and recover each claim that Client may have
        under the Interchange Fee Settlement. Client hereby irrevocably
        authorizes Service Provider to act as the sole point of contact for any
        court, claims administrator, class counsel, or other parties associated
        with any Interchange Fee Settlement; to prepare, sign, and submit claims
        forms with respect to each potential Claim; to receive, endorse,
        negotiate, and deposit settlement checks with respect to any Claim; and
        to take all other actions reasonably necessary to evaluate, prepare,
        pursue, and maximize each potential Claim, and to respond to any audit
        or inquiry with respect thereto. Client will reasonably cooperate with
        Service Provider to facilitate all such actions. In furtherance of that
        end, Client will:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Provide to Service Provider all information in Client’s possession
          that Service Provider reasonably determines is required to determine
          the eligibility of, prepare, or submit any potential Claim, to
          evaluate, contest, challenge, or appeal any Claim Estimate, to respond
          to any Claim-related audit or inquiry, or otherwise to provide the
          Services (collectively, “Claim Submission Data”). Upon Service
          Provider’s request, Client will represent to Service Provider in
          writing that the Claim Submission Data it provides to Service Provider
          is accurate and complete.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sign and have notarized from time to time such limited powers of
          attorney as Service Provider may reasonably request.
        </li>
        <li>
          Refrain from communicating directly with any court, claims
          administrator, class counsel, or other parties associated with any
          Interchange Fee Settlement.
        </li>
        <li>
          Retain all Claim Submission Data relevant to its Claims until notified
          that the Interchange Fee Settlement claim process is complete.
        </li>
        <li>
          If any Recovery Amount or Residual Amount is, despite Service
          Provider’s contrary instructions to any applicable claims
          administrator, paid directly to Client, promptly pay to Service
          Provider the full amount of the fees it would have been entitled
          pursuant to this agreement to retain out of such Recovery Amount or
          Residual Amount, as the case may be, if payment had been made directly
          to Service Provider.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        As full and complete compensation for the Services (including any
        expenses incurred by Service Provider in connection with providing the
        Services), Service Provider will be entitled to retain 30.0 percent of
        the Recovery Amount and, if applicable, 30.0 percent of the Residual
        Amount actually paid with respect to each Claim.
      </p>
      <p>
        No amendment of this agreement will be enforceable unless such amendment
        is in writing, expressly refers to this agreement, and is signed by each
        party.
      </p>
      <p>
        This agreement will be governed exclusively by and construed and
        enforced exclusively in accordance with the laws of New York. Each party
        hereby submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of any court of New York
        and any federal court of the United States of America, in either case,
        sitting in the city and county of New York, and any appellate court
        therefrom, over all legal actions relating to this agreement or the
        Services.
      </p>
      <p>
        The non-prevailing party in any legal action between the parties
        relating to this agreement or the Services will promptly reimburse the
        prevailing party for all reasonable attorneys’ fees and court costs
        incurred by the prevailing party in connection with such legal action.
