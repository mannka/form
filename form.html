          In connection with the case, In Re Payment Card Interchange Fee and
          Merchant Discount Antitrust Litigation (the
          <strong>“Visa/MasterCard Settlement”</strong>) or (the
          <strong>“Interchange Fee Settlement”</strong>), Brownstone Recovery
          Group, Inc. and its agents and representatives (collectively,
          <strong>“Service Provider”</strong>) will provide to merchants the
          following claim recovery services (collectively, the
          <strong>“Services”</strong>):
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Request from the merchant, client information and documents
            reasonably necessary to determine eligibility for, and to pursue
            recovery of, any potential Interchange Fee Settlement claims.
          </li>
          <li>
            Review, organize, and identify gaps in client-provided information
            and documents.
          </li>
          <li>Determine claim eligibility.</li>
          <li>
            For each eligible claim (each, a <strong>“Claim”</strong>), prepare
            applicable claim forms and supporting documentation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Submit claim forms and supporting documentation for each Claim to
            the Interchange Fee Settlement claims administrator.
          </li>
          <li>
            Follow up with the claims administrator to obtain an estimate of the
            amount payable with respect to each Claim (in each case, a
            <strong>“Claim Estimate”</strong>), if not otherwise provided.
          </li>
          <li>
            Evaluate the sufficiency of each Claim Estimate, on the basis of
            information made available to Service Provider and to the extent
            deemed appropriate by Service Provider.
          </li>
          <li>
            To the extent permitted by the settlement agreement and commercially
            reasonable, contest, challenge, and appeal the Claim Estimate or any
            claim denial with respect to each Claim with a view to maximizing
            the final determination of the recovery amount with respect to such
            Claim (in each case, the <strong>“Recovery Amount”</strong>).
          </li>
          <li>
            Obtain from the claims administrator payment of the Recovery Amount
            with respect to each Claim as soon as practicable after the final
            determination thereof is made.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the claims administrator makes any pro rata or other additional
            distribution of the remaining balance of any settlement fund to
            settlement fund claimants, obtain from such claims administrator all
            residual amounts payable with respect to each Claim in connection
            with such distribution (in each case, the
            <strong>“Residual Amount”</strong>).
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>The undersigned (<strong>“Client”</strong>) understands that:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Service Provider is not affiliated with any court, claims
            administrator, class counsel, or other parties associated with any
            Interchange Fee Settlement.
          </li>
          <li>
            Service Provider is not a law firm and does not and will not give
            Client any legal advice.
          </li>
          <li>
            Service Provider does not guarantee that any potential claim will be
            eligible, that any eligible claim will result in a recovery, that
            any approved Claim will result in a Recovery Amount greater than the
            Claim Estimate for such Claim, or that any approved Claim will
            result in any Residual Amount payment.
          </li>
          <li>
            Client is not required to avail itself of Service Provider’s
            Services, but is instead entitled to pursue each Claim itself
            directly with the claims administrator of each Interchange Fee
            Settlement.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Notwithstanding the foregoing, Client has determined that, in light of
          the time, effort, and cost it might take to pursue each Claim itself,
          as well as Client’s relative lack of experience and knowledge pursuing
          claims in the nature of those in connection with the Interchange Fee
          Settlements, it is in Client’s best interest to engage Service
          Provider to pursue all such claims on Client’s behalf.
        </p>
        <p>
          In consideration of the foregoing and the other terms and conditions
          of this agreement, the parties agree as follows:
        </p>
        <p>
          Client hereby irrevocably appoints Service Provider as Client’s sole
          and exclusive agent to pursue and recover each claim that Client may
          have under the Interchange Fee Settlement. Client hereby irrevocably
          authorizes Service Provider to act as the sole point of contact for
          any court, claims administrator, class counsel, or other parties
          associated with any Interchange Fee Settlement; to prepare, sign, and
          submit claims forms with respect to each potential Claim; to receive,
          endorse, negotiate, and deposit settlement checks with respect to any
          Claim; and to take all other actions reasonably necessary to evaluate,
          prepare, pursue, and maximize each potential Claim, and to respond to
          any audit or inquiry with respect thereto. Client will reasonably
          cooperate with Service Provider to facilitate all such actions. In
          furtherance of that end, Client will:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Provide to Service Provider all information in Client’s possession
            that Service Provider reasonably determines is required to determine
            the eligibility of, prepare, or submit any potential Claim, to
            evaluate, contest, challenge, or appeal any Claim Estimate, to
            respond to any Claim-related audit or inquiry, or otherwise to
            provide the Services (collectively, “Claim Submission Data”). Upon
            Service Provider’s request, Client will represent to Service
            Provider in writing that the Claim Submission Data it provides to
            Service Provider is accurate and complete.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sign and have notarized from time to time such limited powers of
            attorney as Service Provider may reasonably request.
          </li>
          <li>
            Refrain from communicating directly with any court, claims
            administrator, class counsel, or other parties associated with any
            Interchange Fee Settlement.
          </li>
          <li>
            Retain all Claim Submission Data relevant to its Claims until
            notified that the Interchange Fee Settlement claim process is
            complete.
          </li>
          <li>
            If any Recovery Amount or Residual Amount is, despite Service
            Provider’s contrary instructions to any applicable claims
            administrator, paid directly to Client, promptly pay to Service
            Provider the full amount of the fees it would have been entitled
            pursuant to this agreement to retain out of such Recovery Amount or
            Residual Amount, as the case may be, if payment had been made
            directly to Service Provider.
